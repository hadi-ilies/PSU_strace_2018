> strace traces a program in real time and displays all of the system calls it executes in their order of appearance.Develop an alternative to strace that implementing the following options: ‚Ä¢-p: force a specific PID instead of executing a command ‚Ä¢-s: display the detailled arguments (see below).By default, your strace must only display the arguments and return values in hexadecimal form.If the system call has a void return value, display a question mark.With-soption, your program must be as close as possible to thestracecommand on your system,and therefore display the following:‚Ä¢integers in decimal form,‚Ä¢pointers on a character string in the form of a character string,‚Ä¢detailed structures (value for each field).

## Usage

```sh
USAGE: ./strace [-s] [-p <pid>|<command>]
